Show issues that are ready to work on (no blockers):

!`bd ready --limit 10`

Summarize the available work, highlighting:
1. Highest priority items (P0-P1)
2. Any that are assigned to the current user
3. Quick wins (tasks vs features/epics)

Then ask which issue I'd like to work on next, or if I want to see more details about a specific issue.
