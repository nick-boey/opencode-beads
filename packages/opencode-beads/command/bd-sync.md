description: Sync beads with git and check repository status
---

Sync beads issues with git:

!`bd sync`

Check git status:

!`git status`

Report:
1. Whether the beads sync was successful
2. Any uncommitted changes in the repository
3. Whether we're ahead/behind the remote branch
4. If there are uncommitted changes, recommend the next steps (commit, push, etc.)

**IMPORTANT**: Work is NOT complete until changes are pushed to remote. If there are unpushed commits, remind me to run `git push`.
